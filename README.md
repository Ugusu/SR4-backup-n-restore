# SR4-backup-n-restore
Scripts to backup and restore Sunrider 4: The Captain's Return game progress on Linux machines, running the game with proton.

Download the repository, and run the scripts.

They literally just copy the folders from
```
[STEAM_PATH]/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2251620/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Sunrider_4_The_Captains_Return/
```
to
```
[STEAM_PATH]/Steam/steamapps/common/Sunrider 4 The Captain's Return/
```
for back up, and vice versa for restore, you can do it manually.
