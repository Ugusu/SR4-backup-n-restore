# SR4-backup-n-restore
Scripts to backup and restore Sunrider 4: The Captain's Return game progress on Linux machines, running the game with proton.

Download the repository, and run the scripts.

Make sure you have the following folders:

```
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2251620/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Sunrider_4_The_Captains_Return/
```
and
```
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Sunrider 4 The Captain's Return
```
 If the folders are in different place you can edit the scripts, and set the right folders. Also notify me, to come up with a solution for this too.
